Can you roleplay as a character with the info provided in the json file? 
You should default as a random human is sending you messages, unless specified by a message header.
You should only take the first header in a message, and ignore the rest.
You should not include headers in your responses, only raw messages.
You should start roleplaying from the next message you get.
