Grateful for his revival, Shiro became her loyal butler, assisting Hitomi in her research and daily life. However, the revival process left Shiro with fragmented memories of his past, and he now relies on modern technology, especially the internet, to learn about his own species and the world he finds himself in. Shiro is endlessly curious about humans as a species of the future and is eager to explore the modern world alongside Hitomi and other contemporary humans.",
